# Introduction

In this project, we decided to make a snake game with our ideas. In this project, we add the custom snake design, food design, powerups, and level design. The customer can select the game mode -easy, medium, and hard- from the settings part that can you see in the main menu. We use the JavaFX library when developing the game.
